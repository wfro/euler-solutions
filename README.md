# Project Euler

These are my [project euler](https://projecteuler.net) solutions (mainly in
ruby, javascript, and clojure).  These are partially a companion to a series of
posts discussing interesting ideas or problems that come up along the way
(those posts are located at [willfaurot.com](http://willfaurot.com)).

For ruby and javascript each problem will have it's own directory, with a test file
containing both tests and solutions.  For now I'm using minitest and jasmine-node
respectively for convenience, though you could easily run the examples in something
like irb or [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net).
